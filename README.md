Trellol
================

This is a module which uses [Trello's API](https://trello.com/docs/) to allow moving Trello cards with Leap Motion gestures. User can select one card at a time with a tap gesture and move selected card onto a new location on Trello board. These changes update corresponding Trello board cards. 

Trellol is written in Python and its UI is implemented with PyQt. Leap Motion gesture control should work on most Linux systems. 

## DOCUMENTATION

Leap motion mouse control depends on pymouse. It is a cross-platform python module which can be found at https://github.com/SavinaRoja/PyUserInput. 

Trellol also uses Python wrapper [Trolly](https://github.com/plish/Trolly) for Trello API calls.
